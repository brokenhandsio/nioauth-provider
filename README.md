# NIOAuth Provider

![](https://github.com/brokenhandsio/nioauth-provider/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

An OAuth 2 Provider library built on top of SwiftNIO 2. 

It follows both [RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) and [RFC6750](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) and there is an extensive test suite to make sure it adheres to the specification.

It also implements the [RFC 7662](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7662) specification for Token Introspection, which is useful for microservices with a shared, central authorization server.
